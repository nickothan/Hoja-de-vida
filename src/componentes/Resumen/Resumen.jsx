      <p>
        As a front-end engineer, I use my web development experience to create
        beautiful web user interfaces for our clients. I work in a cooperative
        team environment and enjoy solving complex and ambiguous problems.
        Collaborate with other engineers, product managers, and UX designers
        across the organization. I enhance our operational excellence by
        continually measuring and improving the performance, security, and
        availability of my team's products.
